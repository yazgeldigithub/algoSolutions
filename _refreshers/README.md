S.NO	Linear Data Structure	Non-linear Data Structure
1.	In a linear data structure, data elements are arranged in a linear order where each and every elements are attached to its previous and next adjacent.	In a non-linear data structure, data elements are attached in hierarchically manner.
2.	In linear data structure, single level is involved.	Whereas in non-linear data structure, multiple levels are involved.
3.	Its implementation is easy in comparison to non-linear data structure.	While its implementation is complex in comparison to linear data structure.
4.	In linear data structure, data elements can be traversed in a single run only.	While in non-linear data structure, data elements canâ€™t be traversed in a single run only.
5.	In a linear data structure, memory is not utilized in an efficient way.	While in a non-linear data structure, memory is utilized in an efficient way.
6.	Its examples are: array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.	While its examples are: trees and graphs.
7.	Applications of linear data structures are mainly in application software development.	Applications of non-linear data structures are in Artificial Intelligence and image processing.
