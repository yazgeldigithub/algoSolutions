# Imagine a school that children attend for years. In each year, there are a certain number of groups started,
# marked with the letters. So if years = 7 and groups = 4For the first year, the groups are 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d,
# and for the last year, the groups are 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d.
#
# Write a function that returns the groups in the school by year (as a string), separated with a comma and space in
# the form of "1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 2a, 2b (....) 6d, 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d".
#
# Examples:
#
# csSchoolYearsAndGroups(years = 7, groups = 4) âžž "1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d,
# 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 6a, 6b, 6c, 6d, 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d"

def SchoolYearsAndGroups(years, groups):
    res = []
    for i in range(1, years + 1):
        for j in range(97, groups + 97):
            res.append(f"{i}{chr(j)}")
    return ", ".join(res)


print(SchoolYearsAndGroups(3, 3))  # 1a, 1b, 1c, 2a, 2b, 2c, 3a, 3b, 3c

The chr() method returns a character (a string) from an integer (the unicode numeric representation of the character )

The ord() method returns an integer representing the Unicode character

'''
A walkthrough of the solution. Two loops. One for years and one for groups.
Line 18 loops through the range of years.  We need years + 1, because we're starting with
year 1.  Range normally starts with 0. If we didn't, the above years would be passed through
as 1 to 3. 
Line 19 is another loop to handle the groups.
Starting with the range. ord('a') will return 97. ord(chr(97 + groups))) will first take in the numeric value from groups and add to 97; for instance, 97 + 1 = 98, 98 + 1 = 98. chr will turn those into letters, then ord will turn them into integers.  chr(i) takes that integer and turns it into a string (e.g., a, b, c, etc).
The results [: -2] returns the solution without the trailing comma and quote mark.
